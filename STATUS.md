# Session status / handoff

Working notes for picking the project back up on another machine. Living doc —
update the top block each session.

## ▶ PICK UP HERE (updated 2026-07-07 — strategy captured, research in repo)

**2026-07-07 session additions (on top of the #5.2 deploy below):** UI polish
+ the OpenRouter structured-output fix + account-page model routing all live
on prod; BACKLOG gained **#9–#12** (per-channel email + off-platform socials,
the two impression checkpoints incl. the month-one 20-videos/100k bar +
never-delete rule, SEO/AEO metadata engine, info-gain niches + stack prefs)
and the **#6 rewrite** (derived shorts publish on a LINKED companion channel,
never the long-form channel). Research findings live in `docs/research/`
(account architecture + SEO/AEO ruleset). The **viability guardrail build is
PARKED as WIP on the working branch** (impressions column + policy;
`ecd8d08`) — resume it after reading the account research, folding in the
month-one checkpoint. YouTube Analytics impressions availability still needs
a live-channel probe (real adapter reports null until then).

## Previous handoff (2026-07-06 late, Build #5.2 MERGED + deploying)

**Build #5.2 — review board + operator briefings + experimentation — is
MERGED to `main`** (`67a134c`, PR #2) and auto-deploying to the droplet via
the push webhook; the compose `migrate` one-shot applies migration **0008**
(channel_briefings, experiments, productions.experiment_id, 3 new decision
kinds — purely additive) before the new code starts. Full scope + file map in
`BACKLOG.md` #5 → "#5.2 shipped". What landed: the multi-checker pre-publish
review board (compliance / charter-alignment / platform-safety hard checkers
+ advisory retention prediction, wired after the variation check with the
on_hold + evidence-row triad), operator briefings on the charter's
`checkinCadence` (daily `operator-briefing` cron, cockpit **Briefings tab**,
responses → `briefing_response` decision rows → planner/writer prompts), and
one-variable experiments (proposed in briefings, operator-approved on T0/T1 /
auto on T2+, scriptwriter directive + production tagging, deterministic
conclusion vs channel baseline).

**Health:** `pnpm typecheck` 13/13, `pnpm test` 115 (61 core + 52 providers +
2 worker) — all green. **Merged ahead of the e2e by operator call** (sandbox
has no Docker; prod has no charter'd channels yet, so nothing exercises the
new paths until the aviation channel exists): run `scripts/build52-test.mjs`
on the desktop as belt-and-suspenders (local stack + `pnpm db:migrate` first).

**Operator to-dos (phone-friendly — no SSH needed):**
1. **Account secrets on `/account`** (encrypted in the DB, override env, take
   effect immediately — no redeploy):
   - **DO Spaces:** `S3_ENDPOINT` (`https://<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com`),
     `S3_REGION`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
     New renders/assets write to Spaces from then on (BACKLOG #7 keep-finals).
   - **YouTube:** save `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID` + `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET` on
     /account, then connect each channel via its **Settings tab → Connect
     YouTube** (per-channel refresh token lands encrypted automatically —
     never paste per-channel tokens by hand). Prereq in Google Cloud console:
     add `https://app.commongroundsocial.com.au/api/oauth/youtube/callback`
     as an authorized redirect URI. The global `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN` field
     is only the v1 single-token fallback — per-channel OAuth supersedes it.
   - Provider keys as needed: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (real LLM),
     `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (voice), `FAL_KEY` (media).
   - Env-only knobs (droplet `.env` + redeploy, NOT on /account):
     `RESEARCH_PROVIDER=youtube`, `SOURCE_CONNECTORS=real`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     (embeddings), Inngest keys, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (rotating it
     orphans stored keys — re-enter them on /account after).
2. **Create the REAL aviation channel** via the wizard (`/channels/new`,
   works from a phone) → Briefings tab → "Run check-in now" to see #5.2 live.
   Hand-provision YouTube (wizard's last step checklist) + OAuth when home.
3. Desktop: `node scripts/build52-test.mjs`; sanity-poke wizard + Plan tab on
   prod.
4. Next build candidates: #6 (format modes), #7 (assets + Spaces storage),
   or the vidIQ transcript fix filed on #4.

## Previous handoff (2026-07-06, Build #5 shipped locally)

**Build #5 — the editorial engine (core loop) — is BUILT and e2e-verified
locally** (full status in `BACKLOG.md` #5). Scope was agreed with the operator:
core loop this build (charter + wizard → source connectors → tiered
verification → series planner → pgvector memory); review board, briefings and
experimentation are **#5.2**. Per-video human gate stays ON for the starter
channel; briefings will be in-platform.

**e2e proof (scripts/build5-test.mjs, all mocked, passed 2026-07-06):** wizard
created an aviation-history channel with an AI charter + identity ("The
Aviation Files"), the planner proposed a 12-episode arc (operator-approved on
the Plan tab), episode research verified claims tiered (per episode: 3
verified across 2 independent mock domains, 1 attributed, 1 deliberately cut),
the factuality gate passed citations into the script gate UI, the full
pipeline rendered + published, the coverage summary carried into channel-scope
memory (episode dump marked prunable), and the charter-less physics channel
ran the pipeline with the gate skipped (regression). DB invariants checked:
scope tiers, distinct-domain citations, claim statuses.

**✅ DEPLOYED TO PROD (2026-07-06 evening).** The push webhook auto-deployed
`main`@`8a21c5c`: postgres recreated on `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`, migrations
0006+0007 applied, `vector` extension live, all 6 new tables present, site
healthy. The auto-deploy reused the alpine-initialized volume, so the
musl→glibc collation risk was closed by hand with `REINDEX DATABASE ytauto`
(datcollversion was NULL — musl never recorded one — so no refresh needed;
zero mismatch warnings). The full dump/restore playbook in DEPLOY.md was NOT
needed but stays documented; the pre-deploy dump is kept at
`/root/ytauto-pre-build5.sql` on the droplet as rollback — delete it once #5
has run on prod for a while.

**Next session:** (1) sanity-poke the wizard + Plan tab on prod
(https://app.commongroundsocial.com.au/channels/new); (2) create the REAL
aviation channel via the wizard, hand-provision the YouTube channel
(checklist is the wizard's last step), connect OAuth; (3) build #5.2
(review board, in-platform briefings, experimentation).

Gotcha for local dev: turbo v2 strict env strips `.env` vars from `pnpm dev` —
run cockpit (`apps/cockpit: next dev -p 3000`) and worker
(`apps/worker: tsx watch src/index.ts`) directly with the env exported, or
export the vars in your shell first. Local dev infra (pgvector Postgres/
Inngest/MinIO in Docker + both dev servers) may still be running from the e2e.

- **Last updated:** 2026-07-06 (Build #5 build session)
- **Branch:** `main` (Build #5 merged from `build5-editorial-engine`)
- **Repo:** `github.com/adawg85/YT-Auto-Platform-`
- **Health:** `pnpm typecheck` (13/13) and `pnpm test` (93: 48 core + 45
  providers) green; `node scripts/build5-test.mjs` passed.
- **Tree:** clean.
- **Prod:** `main`@`8a21c5c` (Build #5) live on the pgvector image, reindexed.
  Rollback dump: `/root/ytauto-pre-build5.sql` on the droplet.

## Verification results (2026-07-06, networked desktop + live droplet)

Both open runtime items from Builds #3/#4 were exercised for the first time on a
real machine (the cloud sandbox couldn't):

- **✅ `youtube` research backend (discovery) — WORKS live.** Drove the real
  provider against youtube.com for "aviation history": `outliers`,
  `trendingVideos`, `breakoutChannels`, `keywords` all return real, correctly
  parsed + ranked data. `RESEARCH_PROVIDER=youtube` is trustworthy for discovery.
- **🐞 external transcript deep-read — BLOCKED by YouTube (filed on BACKLOG #4).**
  `transcript()` returns null for every video: youtubei.js 17.2.0 (latest)
  `getTranscript()` → HTTP 400; direct `timedtext` → HTTP 200 w/ 0 bytes (YouTube
  now requires a proof-of-origin token). Degrades gracefully (no crash). Interim:
  topic-signal clustering still works; source hook/script patterns from our OWN
  videos (build #3.2) instead of competitors'. Fix later via a POT-token provider
  or vidIQ's `video_transcript`.
- **✅ warm-up scheduling — VERIFIED against real Postgres.** Ran the exact
  pipeline path (`production-pipeline.ts:517-530`: `channelWarmupState` DB read →
  `planWarmupRelease`) on the seeded channel. Case A (week 1, cap 3, 0 released) →
  next Shorts daypart (Thu 18:00Z), throttled not immediate. Case B (cap hit via
  real published rows) → deferred to the next ramp week's daypart. The only seam
  not exercised is the Inngest `step.run` wrapper around that logic (identical to
  every other verified step in the same function) — a full `pnpm dev` pipeline run
  through Remotion render remains optional belt-and-suspenders.

## What shipped this session

Build #4 — the meta-analysis engine — landed in two commits:

1. **`dc05d6b` — meta-analysis engine (mock-first).** External scouting into the
   shared pattern store: `external_videos` table (migration 0005), the
   `runMetaAnalysisForNiche` engine (ingest outliers/breakout/trending →
   deep-read transcripts into hook + script-structure patterns → cluster topic
   signals, all `source="external"` in the same `patterns` table our own videos
   write to). Daily `market-scan` Inngest cron + on-demand event. Grounding
   wired into ideation/scoring/scriptwriter (`patternGrounding`,
   freshness-decayed). Anti-clone variation check vs scouted transcripts.
   Cockpit **Market intel** nav page + per-channel "What's working" panel.
   Also fixed a #3.2 gap (analytics-ingest was dropping retention-curve columns).
   Verified end-to-end against a real Postgres.

2. **`8ecc325` — real research backends.** Two `ResearchProvider` implementations
   behind the same interface, selected by `RESEARCH_PROVIDER`:
   - **`youtube`** (MIT, free, keyless) — `youtubei.js`/InnerTube; outlier +
     velocity computed in-house; no keyword volume.
   - **`vidiq`** (premium, `VIDIQ_API_KEY`) — vidIQ's MCP server via
     `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`; adds keyword volume + breakout scoring.
   - Default stays **mock** (offline/CI safe).

⚠️ **Not yet runtime-verified:** the live research transports were never
exercised — the cloud sandbox blocks `youtube.com` and vidIQ's endpoint. Mappers
are unit-tested (vidIQ against real captured responses) and both adapters
typecheck against the installed SDKs, but **first-deploy smoke-testing on a
networked machine is still required** (that's largely why this handoff exists —
your laptop/desktop can do it).

## Product direction captured today (design only — no code; see BACKLOG #5–#8)

Today was a design session — no code shipped; the vision for autonomous,
per-channel content engines is now fully specced in `BACKLOG.md`. Decisions:

- **First channel: Aviation history.** A vidIQ ghost-niche discovery pass picked
  it — low competition, *tiny* channels (2–6k subs) proven to break out to
  70–100k views, deep evergreen catalog (one aircraft per episode),
  monetisation-safe. 5 ranked candidates + data at the top of BACKLOG #5.
- **#5 Editorial engine (the next big build):** per-channel **charter** (mission/
  objectives/archetype/source strategy/verification bar) with AI-proposed channel
  identity; pluggable **source connectors**; **tiered accuracy** (established fact
  ≥2 independent sources, vs emerging = "reported/claimed"; contested history runs
  a **"present-the-debate"** mode — attribute, never assert); a **stateful
  series/plan** that researches the next arc ahead; a **multi-checker AI review
  board** (replaces per-video human review); **configurable weekly/monthly**
  operator check-ins; controlled one-variable experimentation.
- **Per-channel memory:** split **canonical/structured** (Postgres, exact
  queries) from **semantic** (pgvector RAG, `channelId`-scoped, mock-first
  `EmbeddingProvider`) — **pgvector, not a separate vector DB**. **Scope tiers:**
  a video's raw research dump stays **episode-local** (no cross-video bleed);
  only transcript + coverage summary + decisions + explicitly-general research
  carry over into channel memory.
- **#6 Format modes:** shorts-only | long-only | long→derived-shorts, per channel.
- **#7 Assets + storage:** licensed stock images/b-roll + (spicier) source
  footage. **Storage = DigitalOcean Spaces** (already wired via `s3.ts`; we're on
  DO). **Keep every final video permanently** — YouTube can block/remove/
  unpublish, so it is NOT the durable copy; prune only intermediates + the
  re-fetchable source cache.
- **#8 Reactive/topical channels** (tweet/sports/news → fast shorts): **PARKED**
  with ToS/legal notes; revisit after the evergreen engine is proven.
- **Channel provisioning:** the platform **cannot auto-create** YouTube channels
  (no API; title/@handle/avatar are manual). Operator creates + brands by hand,
  connects via per-channel OAuth — a natural creation-time checkpoint.

## Get running on a fresh machine

```bash
# prereqs: Node >= 22, pnpm 10, Docker (for local Postgres/Inngest)
git clone <repo> && cd YT-Auto-Platform-
git checkout claude/session-recap-p3q2qt
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env          # then edit (see below)

pnpm typecheck                # 13/13 expected
pnpm test                     # 77 expected

# full local stack (Postgres + Inngest + worker + cockpit):
docker compose up -d          # see docker-compose.yml / DEPLOY.md
pnpm db:migrate               # applies migrations incl. 0005 (external_videos)
pnpm db:seed                  # optional demo data
pnpm dev                      # turbo: cockpit :3000, worker :3010
```

`.env` essentials: `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
(`openssl rand -hex 32`), and — new this session — `RESEARCH_PROVIDER`
(see `.env.example` for the full research block).

---

## Verify the new research backends (the main to-do on your laptop)

Both need real network access YouTube/vidIQ, which the cloud env lacked.

**YouTube (MIT) — free, do this first:**
```bash
# in .env:  RESEARCH_PROVIDER=youtube
# bring the stack up, then trigger a scan from the cockpit:
#   Market intel page → "Run market scan"   (or the button on /market)
# expect: Rising angles + Breakout hook patterns + Scouted videos populate.
# E2E script (full stack up): node scripts/build4-test.mjs
```
If `youtubei.js` shapes have drifted, the defensive extractor in
`packages/providers/src/real/youtube-research.ts` degrades to empty rather than
crashing — check `normalizeVideoNode` / the search-filter call first.

**vidIQ (premium) — only if you want keyword volume / turnkey scoring:**
```bash
# in .env:  RESEARCH_PROVIDER=vidiq  VIDIQ_API_KEY=...  (VIDIQ_MCP_URL if it differs)
```
Transport is `packages/providers/src/real/vidiq-mcp.ts`; mapping is
`packages/providers/src/real/research.ts`. Confirm the MCP endpoint/auth against
vidIQ's docs — the default URL is a best guess.

---

## Next steps (pick up here)

**Verification (done 2026-07-06 — see "Verification results" up top):**
1. ~~Smoke-test the research backends~~ — **`youtube` discovery DONE** (works);
   external transcripts blocked (BACKLOG #4). `vidiq` still untested (needs key).
2. ~~Verify warm-up auto-scheduling~~ — **DONE** against real Postgres (both
   in-ramp + cap-defer branches). Optional: a full `pnpm dev` Inngest pipeline run
   through render for the last untested seam (the `step.run` wrapper).

**Next major build — the editorial engine (BACKLOG #5), aviation starter:**
3. Stand up the **channel charter** (incl. AI-proposed name/@handle/avatar for
   aviation) → **source connectors** → **tiered-accuracy verification** →
   **stateful series planner** → **per-channel memory (pgvector + scope tiers)**
   → **multi-checker review board** → **configurable check-ins**. All specced in
   BACKLOG #5. This is the heart; the scheduler (#3) + analytics/pattern store
   (#4) already plug into it.

**Smaller / later:**
4. `youtube` breakout channels lack subscriber-growth — accrue from our own
   snapshots over time.
5. Build #6 (format modes / long→shorts), #7 (assets + Spaces storage/retention),
   #8 (reactive channels, parked). Builds #1/#2 (UGC, owned-product) still stubs.

See `BACKLOG.md` for full build specs and per-build status — items #1–#8.
